# Week 5

## October 23

* Selection Sort
  * Going over the selection selection sort. This was great because I got the concept right away!

## October 22

* [Bubble Sort](../../algorithms/sort/bubble-sort.md)
  * Sometimes I feel like I learn bubble sort every other month or something.
  * Keep two pointers `i` and `j` . `i` decreases from the end of the list \(because we assume that if it's reached that point then it's already sorted\) and `j` that compares `j > j + 1` if this condition is true then sort.
  * The nested loop will go only until `i` 's length because we want to not doubly sort

## October 21
