# Context vs Scope

## Scope

* Scope refers to the visibility of the variables.
* Scope means what is the variable access of a function when it's invoked
* What is in the variable environment

## Context

* Context is more Object based
* Context says what the value of `this` keyword
* `this` meaning what is the reference to the object that owns that current executing code
* Context is most often determined by how a function is invoked with the value of `this` keyword
