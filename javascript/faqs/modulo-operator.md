# Modulo Operator

I've had a hard time wrapping my head around the `%` operator because it seemed to me to be more in line with division and I couldn't let go of that image. But the way that I'm imagining it now is thinking about it as a remainder when dividing items and the output is the remainder. 

I think about it in fingers, how many times does the denominator go into the numerator and what's the remainder. 

```bash
5 % 5 === 0
5 % 4 === 1
5 % 3 === 2
5 % 2 === 1
5 % 1 === 0
5 % 0 === NaN
```
