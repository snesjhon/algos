# Pass by Value vs Reference

## In Javascript, Pass by Value or Pass by Reference?

Javascript uses a pass by value strategy for primitives but uses a call by sharing for objects. Call by sharing is largely similar to pass by reference in that the function is able to modify the same mutable object but unlike pass by reference isnâ€™t able to assign directly over it.
