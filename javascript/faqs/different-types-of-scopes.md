# Different types of Scopes

### Global Scope

Any variable that's not inside a function or block \(curly brace\).

### Local Scope

Any variable declared inside a function

### Block Scope

This refers to `let` and `const` which unlike `var` are only accessible within the scope that they were defined.

### Lexical Scope

Lexical Scope \(also known as Static Scope\) literally means that scope is determined at the [lexing time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis) \(generally referred to as compiling\) rather than at runtime.
