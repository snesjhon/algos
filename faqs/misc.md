### ++someVariable vs. someVariable++ in JavaScript

Same as in other languages:

- `++x` (pre-increment) means "increment the variable; the value of the expression is the final value"
- `x++` (post-increment) means "remember the original value, then increment the variable; the value of the expression is the original value"
