# I'll never complain about web tooling again.

As much as I hear about JS fatigue or tooling fatigue. I'll always thank all of the open-source creators/contributors for creating such a rich and wonderful ecosystem.



Because, let me tell you. 

As someone who just dipped his toes in using xcode to use swift. Holy snap. xcode/appcode is like being back in the dark ages.

* So you're telling me I have to click "build" \(command + r\) every time? Okay got it. 
* If I want to create a file, I can't do it in the finder. I have to go through xcode because otherwise it won't compile? Sweet. 
* If I full screen xcode, and click compile, it will open the app and immediately focus on it. So swipe back to the window I was using it with. Nice.
* I can't use VIM. ... .. okay.



Honestly, this is all in jest. But there is a lesson here in thanking all the people
