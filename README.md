## My journey in improving my computer science skills

Ever since switching careers from Psychology to Computer Engineering I've always faced impostor syndrome. I believe in my skills and what I'm capable of achieving but I'm not always able to prove it.

Almost all of my interviews have gone sour as I can't get past the algorithm portions. So I'm taking this time \(and this Gitbook\) to keep a running log of everything I'm learning.

I'm adding new sections as I go, but here are the sections.
