# overlappingIntervals

Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Examples" %}
```javascript
Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]] 
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
 
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].

Input: [[1,4],[4,5]] 
Output: [[1,5]] 
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

Input: [[1,4],[0,4]] 
Output: [0,4]

Input: [[1,4],[0,1]] 
Output: [[0,4]]

Input: [[1,4],[0,0]] 
Output: [[0,0],[1,4]]
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Solution" %}
