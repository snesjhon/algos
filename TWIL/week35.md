# This Week I Learned - Wk 35

#### Big O
* Started studying from a Udemy course on JavaScript algorithms [JavaScript (JS) Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass | Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/)
* This has enlightened me to rely on simple heuristic on determining what the BigO of a function will be. 
* Although I haven’t experienced this in my normal day-to-day job I feel like this would at least be helpful in getting a quick glance in how it’d affect React functions since ( at least in hooks) they are composed as regular functions.
